# MyRecipeApp

MyRecipeApp is an Android application that uses Kotlin, MVVM architecture, Retrofit for API integration, and Jetpack Compose for creating a modern UI. The app fetches and displays a list of meal categories from the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/), allowing users to explore various recipes and details.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture:** Clean architecture for easier testing, maintenance, and scalability.
- **Retrofit Integration:** Makes network requests to the MealDB API to fetch meal categories and recipes.
- **Jetpack Compose UI:** A modern, declarative UI framework for building responsive and efficient layouts.
- **Navigation:** Uses Jetpack Navigation Component for seamless navigation between screens.
- **Error Handling:** Shows error messages in case of failed API requests and provides a loading indicator.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
- **Retrofit:** For making API requests and parsing JSON responses.
- **Jetpack Compose:** For building UI using a declarative approach.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Separates concerns by splitting data handling and UI logic.
- **Coroutines:** For handling asynchronous tasks.
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and project hosting.
